This is a Twitter-like system made as the final project for the class of Operating Systems II in the second semester of 2020 (Marchâ€“May 2021) at UFRGS.

To compile the project, use the command `make`. The compilation will generate two binaries, `app_server` and `app_client`, in the main directory.

To execute the server, simply run `./app_server`. To execute the client, assuming the server is running, run `./app_client @<username> 127.0.0.1 4000` (standard IP address and port).
